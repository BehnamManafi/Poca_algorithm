# Poca Algorithm
 Point Of Closest Approach (Poca) in python 
========================================================

The Point of Closest Approach (POCA) algorithm is a method used to determine the closest distance between two lines
or line segments in three-dimensional space. It calculates the point along each line where the distance between them
is minimized.

In the context of image reconstruction, the POCA algorithm can be used in various applications such as tomography or 3D
reconstruction. For example, in tomography, it can be used to determine the intersection points or lines of cosmic muons 
passing through different detectors. By calculating the POCA between the muon tracks and detectors, it becomes possible
to reconstruct the trajectory of the muons and create an image of the scanned object or material.
